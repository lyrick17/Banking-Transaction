# Banking-Transaction
My Small Personal Project - Banking Transaction. 

This is a JavaFX GUI Program that allows user to register an account, log in, deposit, withdraw and print receipt. It is only a small project to practice coding, and it is not intended to be used in a bank. 

In order to fully test the program without the need to create an account, I've created 3 sample accounts to try the login form without creating/opening a new account. You can use these instead. All of them have the same PIN.
Account Number: 12100001
PIN:            123456

Account Number: 12100002
PIN:            123456

Account Number: 12100003
PIN:            123456
